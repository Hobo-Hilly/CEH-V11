# CEH-V11
This is a very long list of all of the notes I took as I completed my CEH. This is kind of like my bible for hacking right now.
And as you all know sharing is caring!

I will be updating this as my understanding of each subject grows. Security is a journey not a destination and I am looking forward 
to the trip! If you are a potential employer. Keep poking around! I have some cool tools on here. : ) Enjoy ya'll!
