APT
Objectives:

    Define APT
    List and explain the common attributes of APT
    Define and describe the phases of the APT lifecycle

    Today we're discussing APT, and I've heard this term thrown around in the Cyber Security space quite a bit, but there seems to be some mystery surrounding the idea. Can you help clear this up a bit for us and define APT?
        Advanced Persistent Threat
            Can be used in reference to APT GROUPS and their capabilities, sophistication, and objectives
                Fancy Bear (Russia, APT 28)
                Lazaraus Group (N.Korea, APT 38)

                https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html
                https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2021/101967/
            Also used to reference the malware used by these groups

    Let's dig into the details of those APT characteristics.
        Goal Oriented
            They are after sensitive information
                That info could be...
                    PHI
                    PII
                    State Secrets
                    Intellectual Property
                    Financials
                    Research and Development
                    Political or Activists Statements
            Long-Term Access
                No smash and grab!
                They look to maintain access for as long as possible
            Patient
                Which in turn makes them stealthy
            Highly Skilled
                Develop custom Zero-day exploits
                Advanced competency in multiple OSs, networking, programming, web, etc
                Able to evade security controls
                Attack from multiple vectors
                Multi-staged attacks
            Resourceful
                Living off the Land
                Command and Control access

    Now that we know what APT is and their attributes, let's turn our attention to the APT Lifecycle. What is the APT Lifecycle and what are its details we need to be aware of?
        'step-by-step' of phases that APT typically goes through when attacking a target
            6 phases
                Preparation
                    Choosing and defining a target
                    Intelligence gathering
                    Acquire or create tools
                    Test for detection
                Initial Intrusion
                    Malware deployment
                    Establish a connection
                Expansion
                    Expand Access
                    Gather Creds
                Persistence
                    Maintaining Access
                Search and Exfil
                    Gather sensitive data
                    Exfil data to attacker controlled device
                Cleanup
                    Covering Tracks
                    Persist undetected for as long as possible
