Password Extraction and Cracking
Objectives:

    List common tools utilized to extract password hashes
    Utilize password hash extraction tools to retrieve password hashes
    Explain the process of LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning
    Utilize freely available tools to execute LLMNR poisoning attack
    Define password salting
    List and explain common password policies used to defend against password attacks

    How do we get the password hashes from target computers?
        Post-compromise activity (usually)   

# i.e. We have already gotten onto the machine.
# I upload the tool
# I run the tool
# tool reaches into the machine and dumps passwords out into a file. In format in which I can read the thing. Then we have the HASHED password

        Windows Tools
            pwdump7
#            fgdump              ** has the nicest output

# Just to remind you that we are just getting passwords here. Cracking them is a different step.

#Whats happening??



- So now that this is running it is starting to poison the network
- It is now starting a man in the middle like attack.
- now that it's sat in the middle of the network it is listening for any authentication events.
- So now when a windows Client on the network goes to look for something like a windows share.
- Instead of running to DNS occasionally to speed things up it will try to obtain the information using...  NBT-NS / LLMNR / MDNS.
- and if when it defaults to one of those protocols while my attacking machine has responder running.
- I can intercept that transmission while it's going over the wire using responder.

# So our attacking machine stands up and say's yeah bro i got that resolution right here.



	So the authentication system sends a password hash to the machine that reached out for the authentication
	and we intercept the hash using responder.
Anything that looks like Net NTLM V2 authentication will be snagged by responder.

- Basically any NTLM V2 authentication 

        Linux
            cat
        Web/Database attacks
            Attacker could retrieve hashes from insecure web app




    How do we crack these hashes to reveal the passwords?
        John the Ripper
            Dictionary
            Rules
        OCL-Hashcat
            Brute
        Ophcrack
            Rainbow Tables
        Pass-the-Hash
            Don't even need to crack the hash
            Some systems will just use the hash
    Any good countermeasures?
        Good password policies
            Sufficient length
            Sufficient character sets
            No dictionary words
            Salt
    Any other ways to grab passwords?
        Key loggers
            Software-based
            Hardware-based

Rainbow Tables are pre hashed values
The files are large
The more you have the faster it is
Since it is just taking the hashed value of the password and comapring it with other hash values. It goes much faster than 
typical methonds like john and hashcat above.
There is one less layer obstructing us form our goals. Because technically we never crack this password password. we just found a match
for its hashed value version.
