Malware Concepts and Components
Objectives:

    Define Malware
    List the common malware types
    Explain how malware spreads
    List and define common components that make up, or are used by Malware

    We hear a lot about Malware these days, but I have trouble understanding that term. Can you help me out by defining malware and how that differs from other harmful software?

            Worms
            Ransomware

    It seems that malware does a pretty good job of spreading. Why is that? What are the methods malware use to spread?
        Email attachments/links
        Software installs from untrusted sources
        OS/Software vulnerabilities

    What are some of the components that are common to malware?
        Downloaders
        Droppers
        Obfuscators and Crypters
        Payloads
        Exploits

    OK, so what is the purpose of malware? Are hackers just bored and looking to cause chaos, or are there more tangible reasons?
        Chaos? Yes
