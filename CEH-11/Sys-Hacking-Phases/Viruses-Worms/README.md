Objectives:

    Define Viruses and and Worms and explain their characteristics
    List the phases of the Virus Lifecycle
    List and define the common virus types

    What is the difference between viruses and worms?
        Virus
            Malicious software that attaches itself to host file or program

            Requires human interaction to activate
        Worm
            Spreads independently through software vulnerabilities
            Doesn't require human interaction
    What are typical goals?
        Destruction/damage of systems
        Cyber theft
        Chaos!
        Hacktivism
    What are symptoms of infection?
