CEH Hacking Methodology and Goals
Objectives:

    List and describe the phases of the CEH Hacking Methodology
    List and describe the goals of an attacker at specific phases of CEH Hacking Methodology

    What do we mean by 'Methodology'?
        Systematized approach to reaching a goal
            System is derived from research and observation

    What is the CEH Methodology?
        EC-Council's system for successfully hacking a target

    Where does it fit in what we've learned so far?
1.        Recon/Footprinting
  

2.        Scanning


3.        Enumeration


4.        Vuln Assessment
 

5.       System Hacking


6.            Gaining Access

7.                Password Cracking
 
8.               Vulnerability Exploitation

9.            Priv Esc

10.	Maintaining Access

11.            Clearing Logs

    What are our goals in System Hacking?
        Gaining access
            Bypass security controls, or finding system misconfigurations to access the target system
                Techniques
                    Password cracking
                    Vuln Exploitation
                    Social Engineering

            Vertical priv esc
                Techniques
                    Vuln Exploitation
                    Security misconfiguration
        Execute Apps
            aka Maintaining Access
                Techniques
                    Malware

        Covering Tracks
            Hide/obfuscate evidence
                Techniques
                    Log clearing

Destroying evidence

average amount of time a hacker is in a system before he is
discovered is 200 days. roughly 9 months
