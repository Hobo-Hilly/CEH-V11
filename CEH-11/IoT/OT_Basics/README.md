OT Basics
Objectives:

-    Define Operational Technology(OT)
-    Define essential terms and concepts associated with OT
-    Describe the security challenges related to OT

#    What is OT
        Operational Technology
            Managing, Monitoring, and Controlling industrial operations
                Focused on the physical devices and processes they use

#    OT Components/Systems
-        ICS (Industrial Control System)

-        SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition)
            Gathers and presents data to operators
            Make decisions about processes with the aid of operator input
            Control plant functions based on those decisions

-        DCS (Distributed Control System)
            Like SCADA, but focused more on automation

-        PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
             Siemens makes these devices

-        RTU (Remote Terminal Unit)
            aka Remote Telemetry Unit and Remote Telecontrol Unit
                A 'beefed-up' PLC
                    Better environmental tolerances
                    Backup power options
                    Autonomy


-        BPCS (Basic Process Control System)



-        SIS (Safety Instrumented Systems)
            Sensors, logic solvers, and final control elements
                Protects personnel, equipment, and environment
                    Isolates the plant in case of an emergency


-        HMI (Human Machine Interface)
            Screen that allows a human to interact with a machine
                Data input/output
                    Subset of SCADA


-        IED (Intelligent Electronic Devices)
            Devices that receive data from sensors and/or power equipment
                Issue control commands like
                    Tripping breakers during voltage/current/frequency anomalies
                        Example device: voltage regulator


-        IIOT (Industrial Internet of Things)
            The convergence of OT and IT
                Using traditional IT infrastructure to manage OT devices



-    OT Security Challenges
        Plain Text Passwords/Protocols
        Complexity
        Proprietary tech
        Legacy Tech
        Lack of security professionals
        Converging with IT brings in IT Security issues
