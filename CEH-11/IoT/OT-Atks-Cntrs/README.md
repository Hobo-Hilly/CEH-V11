OT Attacks, Tools, and Countermeasures
Objectives:

    List and explain common OT vulnerabilities and threats
    List and describe commonly used OT hacking tools
    List and describe common security controls and best practices used to defend OT networks

#    OT Vulnerabilities
-        Internet-connected OT systems
-        OT System connected to system that is connected to Internet
-        Missing or Non-existent updates
-        Weak passwords and/or no authentication
-        Weak firewall rules (ingress/egress)
-        Non-existent network segmentation
-        Weak or non-existent encryption

#    OT Threats
-        Malware
            Introduced through
-                Removable Media
-                External hardware
-                via Internet
                    IT connected systems
-                        Web / Database
-                        Compromised Cloud
-                        Infected end-user devices
#        DoS/DDoS
        Sensitive data exposure


#        HMI-based Attacks
-            Buffer Overflows
-            Authentication/Authorization
-                Creds in Clear-text
-                Hard-coded creds
-                Sensitive info transmitted in the clear
        Human Error


#        Side-Channel attacks
-            Monitoring physical aspects of the OT
-                Timing Analysis
-                    Observe the time it takes to complete password auth process
                        Deduce password or crypto-key
#                Power Analysis
-                    Attacker using a oscilloscope observes power consumption between clock cycles
#        RF Connected controller attacks (attacks against RF communications)

            Replay attacks
-                Capture and replay legit command traffic

            Command Injection
-                Create and inject malicious traffic

            Malicious RF Controller Re-pairing attack
-                "Evil" Controller

            Malicious Reprogramming attack
-                Evil firmware

#    Tools
-        Shodan
-        SearchDiggity
-        s7scan
-        plcscan
-        smartrf packet sniffer (https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PACKET-SNIFFER-2)
-        ISF (ICS Exploitation Framework)

#    Countermeasures
-        Updates/Patches
-        Secure Coding practices
-        Change defaults (passwords/configs)
-        Secure authentication (strong passwords/MFA)
-        Disable/Secure remote access
-        Encryption
-        Firewalls/IDS/IPS
-        Network Segmentation
-        Security training
-        OT Specific monitoring solutions
-        Honeypots/Honeynets (conpot)
