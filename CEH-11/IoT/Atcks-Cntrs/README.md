IoT Attacks, Tools, and Countermeasures
Objectives:

    List and describe common IoT attacks
    List and describe common IoT hacking tools
    List and describe common IoT security defenses

#    Standard-issue threats
-        SQLi
-        Ransomware
-        DoS
-        MitM
-        RCE

#    Tools
-        Shodan
-        Censys
-        Thingful
-        Wireshark
-        TCPDump
-        Attack Proxy
-        SDR tools (Parrot)

#    DEMO hacking the Foscam
-        NTP Server Command Injection
-            ;/usr/sbin/telnetd -p37 -l /bin/sh;

#    Interesting IoT Attacks
-        HVAC
-            Shodan search for Metasys
#        Rolling Code Attack
-            Automobile hacking
-                Key fob for door locks
-                    Uses rolling code (code can't be used twice in a row)
-                        Attacker blocks/sniffs the unlock signal
-                            Repeat the process
-                               Attacker then sends first code to car
-                                    Car unlocks
-                                        Attacker then uses 2nd code to unlock car later
#        Blueborne
-            Bluetooth vuln
-                Allows for complete takeover of a device
#        DoS by Jamming Attack
#        Sybil Attack
#            VANET(Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network)
                Used to send traffic updates and safety messages between vehicles
                    Sybil disrupts this by simulating traffic congestion

#    Countermeasures
-        The Standards
-            Change Defaults
-            Updates and Patches
-            Encryption
-            Disable unnecessary services
-            Physical Security
-            Logging and Monitoring
-            Lockouts
#        SDR Security
-            Don't use 'Rolling Code'
-            Utilize preamble and synchronization nibbles
-            Use encryption
#        Manufacturer Security
-            Secure boot chain
-                Software verification technique
-            Chain of trust the update process
#        Other Defenses
-            IoT Device Management
-                IBM Watson IoT
-                Predix
-                AT&T
-                Oracle
