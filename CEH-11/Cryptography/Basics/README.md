Cryptography Basics
Objectives:

    Define cryptography
    Articulate the objectives of cryptography
    Explain the concept of GAK
    List and define the types of encryption cyphers in common usage

#    Purpose of Cryptography
-        Protect CIA + Non-Repudiation

#    Crypto Types
-        Symmetric
-        Asymmetric

#    GAK
-        Government Access to Keys
-            All keys are given to Gov
-            Gov securely stores keys
-            Gov can access keys with court order
-            Gov can 'eavesdrop' using keys
#    So this is very similar to getting a court order for a  wiretap order

#    Ciphers

        Classical Ciphers
-            Substitution
-            Transposition


        Key Based
-            Private-key
-                aka Symmetric


            Public-key
-                aka Asymmetric


        Input Based

-            Block Cipher
-            Stream Cipher
