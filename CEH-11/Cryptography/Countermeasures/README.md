Crypto-Attack Countermeasures
Objectives:

    Describe and apply security controls and best practices for mitigating weaknesses in encryption

    Secure key sharing
    Use higher bit length hashing and symmetric key algorithms
        At least 168 bit key size
            Preferably 256 bit
    Use encryption with proven track record of security
        At least 2048 bit key size
    Don't hard-code keys into source code or compiled into a binary
    Encrypt your keys with a password/passphrase
    Use IDS to monitor key exchanges
    Implement Key Stretching
        Makes weak keys stronger through increasing their length
            Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2)
            bcrypt
