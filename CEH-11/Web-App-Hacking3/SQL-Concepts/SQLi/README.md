SQL Injection Concepts
Objectives:

    Define what SQLi is
    List and explain the different types of SQLi
    Explain and demonstrate methods used to discover SQLi vulnerabilities
    Explain the process of a SQLi attack and why it works
    List and explain common types of SQLi IDS signature evasion techniques
    List and describe common security controls and best practices to secure systems against SQLi

    What is SQL Injection and why are we concerned about it?
        HOW?
            Modifying back-end SQL queries
                User can 'inject' T-SQL into original query
        WHY CONCERN?
            CIA of data is compromised
                Data can be:
                    Extracted
                    Modified
                    Deleted
                    Access of target's local file-system
                    Remote access to Target's system commands

    How does this happen?
        Insecure coding
            Trusts user input

    SQL injection types?
        Authentication Bypass
            DEMO an AUTH Bypass and show the code from DVWA to explain
        Error-based SQLi
        Blind SQLi

    How do we discover a possible SQL injection point?
        Manual Discovery
            Look for visible input
                Login forms
                Dynamic site pages
                Search boxes
                URLs with things like '?id=1'
            Invisible input
                Page source
                API calls (DEMO)(just show the API injection point)
        Automation
            Vulnerability Scanners
            SQLi Specific vulnerability scanners
            SQLmap
            SQLNinja
            Mobile sqli tools

    What are some common defenses against SQL Injection?
        Regex filtering aka Input Validation
            Look for special characters and strings used in SQLi
        WAFs
        Least privilege
        Parameterized statements
            Prepared statements

    Are there ways around these defenses?
        Query Obfuscations
            Inline Comments
            Null bytes (%00)
            Use variables
        Encoding special chars
            Hex
            URL
        Concatenation
        Uncommon queries
            Look for 'OR DOG=DOG' instead of 'OR 1=1'
