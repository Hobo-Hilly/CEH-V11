Blind-based SQLi Attacks
Objectives:

-    Explain and demonstrate how to use Blind-based SQLi to access sensitive information

-    Today we're looking into 'Blind' SQL Injection. What does that mean?
        No visible indicators of a (un)successful injection

#    Are there techniques that we can use to verify whether or not an injection is successful?
        Boolean-based
        Time-based

-    Can you show us an example of a Boolean-Based Injection?
#        Boolean Demo
            Test for SQLi with single-quote (')
                Custom error returned, but it looks like special char filtering
-            Try Boolean injection
                TRUE/FALSE conditions
                    ' OR 1=1 -- - is TRUE
                    ' OR 1=3 -- - is FALSE
                        One or both could be useful

#                Now we continue with ORDER BY column enumeration
                    iron man' order by 1 -- -
                        Site throws custom error when invalid column is requested
                            iron man' order by 8 -- -
                                "Invalid Syntax Detected!"
                                    Now we know there are 7 columns in the table
                                        Then continue DB enumeration with UNION SELECT

- Boolean injection can be tidious and time consuming.


#    You also mentioned Time-Based Blind injections? How does that work?

- "Time-based attacks are much more useful"


#        Lack of feedback from injection tests
-            bWAPP Time-based challenge doesn't return ANY ERRORS!
-                Must find some way of verifying test success/failure
-                    Timed responses

    So we force, the app to wait before it responds?
#         Add -sleep() to the test
            iron man' -sleep(1) -- -

-                The site should 'sleep' for 10 seconds, then return results
-                    If site hangs, then SQLi test is successful

-                        This becomes our success/failure indicator
-                            iron man' order by 1 -- - has no indication of success/fail
-                            iron man' order by 8 -- - has no indication of success/fail


-                                Add -sleep(0.5) to make it hang 5 seconds
-                            iron man' -sleep(0.5) order by 1 -- - hangs, SUCCESS!
-                            iron man' -sleep(0.5) order by 8 -- - no hang, FAILURE!
-                                We can then deduce that there are 7 columns in the table
