Mobile Device Management
Objectives:

-    List and describe common mobile device management tools and best practices used to secure mobile devices

-    The need for MDM
#        Allows admins to easily manage mobile devices regardless of OS
            Enable authentications
            Remote lock/wipe
            Jailbreak/Root detection
            Policy enforcement

#    BYOD
        Using personal devices
-        Conform to company policy
-        Benefits
            Productivity
            Flexibility
            Reduced costs
            Happy employees
        Risks
-            Support of variety of devices
-                Increases the attack surface
-            Co-mingling of personal/private data
-            Insecure device disposal
-            Unsecured networks
-                Mobile devices will be constantly accessing untrusted and possibly Unsecured networks
-            Lost/stolen devices
-            Loose control of user activity
-                Users can bypass security policy
                    Example:
                        User can't access www.cewlsite.com over company network
                        User switches to cellular network
#        BYOD Security Policy
-            Will allow for a secure and controllable BYOD environment
-                Define requirements
-                    Who/What/When/Where/Why will this device be used
#               Standardize technology
-                    Hardware and Software
-                        List approved devices
-                        List approved apps
                Formalize policies
-                    Publish and disseminate policy info
                Implement Security
-                    Asset and Identity Management
-                    Local storage control
-                    Removable media control
-                    Network Access Control
-                    Device password
-                    Org vs Personal App control
-                   Web security
-                    Messaging security
-                    Device Health
-                    DLP
                Implement Support
                    Trained support staff

#    General Security Guidelines for Mobile
