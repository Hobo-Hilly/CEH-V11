Network Sniffing Basics
Objectives:

    Define network sniffing
    Explain the process of network sniffing
    Explain the usefulness of network sniffing to an attacker
    Describe how an attacker can sniff a switched network
    List and describe common sniffing attacks against network switches

    Sniffing Concepts and Tools
        Capturing network traffic and inspecting its contents


            Promiscuous Mode
# you need a tool to turn this mode on. We use wireshark. And I am pretty sure so does the rest of the world.

                Wireshark
                TCP-Dump
                Mobile apps
            SPAN port aka "Port Mirroring"
            Hardware Sniffers

#    Sniffing Types
-        Passive
            No activity to solicit or generate further network traffic
-        Active
            Activity which generates more network traffic
                Spoofing
                Poisoning
                Host Compromise
                    Compromised host used as internal sniffer
                Malware


#    Sniffing Switched Networks
        Hubs vs. Switches
        Switching
            Switch Ports

# How does a switch work. They're smart hubs, right? They learn where packets are supposed to go 
# and then only direct packets out of their proper ports


            Content Addressable Memory (CAM) Table
                VLAN ID
                MAC Address
                Port ID
                Learning Mode
                    Broadcasts out all ports


#            CAM Attack
                Flooding the switch with fake MACs will fill up the CAM
                    Learning Mode becomes the default mode
                        Switch fails open to Learning Mode

                        Look at macof man page

#            Switch Port Stealing
                Is a 'MAC spoofing', 'Flooding' and 'Poisoning' attack against switch
                    Flood switch with spoofed MAC via ARP
                        MAC Spoofing Tools
                            macchanger
                            Advanced Properties of Network Interface in Windows
                                Labled 'Network Address'

                                https://technitium.com/tmac/
                    Race real host for control over switch "truth"
                    Switch is fooled or 'Poisoned', data is sent to attacker




#        Other Switch-based attacks
-            VLAN Hopping
                Allows you to access to other VLANs
                    Attacker can now sniff that traffic
                Accomplished through...


-                    Switch Spoofing
                        Attacker-controlled switch
                            Connects to target network
                                Forces trunk link to attacker switch

                    or Double-Tagging
                        Attacker creates Ethernet Frames with 2 802.1Q tags

                            Inner tag



                            Outer tag


                        Target switches receive malicious Frame
                            Strips off outer tag
                                Forwards Frame using Inner tag through all trunk interfaces
            STP Attack
                Attack switch is set to gain Root-Bridge status
                    All traffic now flows through Root-Bridge and can be sniffed
