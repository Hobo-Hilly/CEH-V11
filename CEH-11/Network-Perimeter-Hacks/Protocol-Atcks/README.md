Protocol Attacks
Objectives:

    List and describe common types of Protocol DoS/DDoS attacks

    Give us some info about common Protocol-based DoS/DDoS attacks.

        SYN Flood
            Remember TCP 3-way handshake
                What does the SYN packet do? (starts to establish a connection)
                    The target must track partially open connections (listen queue)
                        Listen Queue tracks for at least 75 seconds
            Attacker sends multiple SYN request
                Never responds to the SYN/ACK (SYN/ACK flood is similar to this attack)
                    sudo hping3 --syn --flood -p RPORT RHOST
                    Target's listen queue is overwhelmed
                        Target can no longer service connection requests

        ACK / PSH-ACK Flood
            Send a bunch of ACK or PSH-ACK packets to target
                LOIC DEMO (tcp attack is a PSH-ACK attack)

        Fragmentation
            Attacker sends large number of fragmented packets
                Target's resources are consumed as it is overwhelmed trying to reassemble fragmented packets
                    Attack is more effective if fragments are randomized
            Can bypass firewalls/IDS/IPS solutions
