Volumetric Attacks
Objectives:

    List and describe common types of Volumetric DoS/DDoS attacks

#    Volumetric Attacks
        Amplification attacks
-            UDP Flood
                Attacker floods target with UDP packets from spoofed IP
                Target checks for UDP service
                Target responds with 'Destination Unreachable' error
                Legit traffic can't access server
-                    hping3 --flood --spoof 192.168.241.133 --udp -p 53 192.168.241.130
#            ICMP Flood
                Reflection networks are useful here
                Requests and Replies saturates the network
-                    hping3 --flood --spoof 192.168.241.133 --icmp -p 53 192.168.241.130
#            Ping of Death
                Oversized packet
-                    Size greater than 65535 bytes
-		     This is a volumetric attack because its all about 
-	             the size of the packet. 

                        System crashes
#            Smurf & Fraggle
                DDoS target with ICMP echo replies
                    Send ICMP echo request to network broadcast address with spoofed source IP of target
                    If network allows directed broadcast requests, all hosts on network will respond to target with ICMP echo replies
                        hping3 --flood --spoof --icmp 192.168.241.130 192.168.241.255
#                Fraggle
                    Similar to Smurf
                        UDP instead of ICMP
                        Targets ports 7(Echo) and 19(CHARGEN)
            Pulse Wave
                Attacker sends data to target for every 10 minutes
                Attack pulses(attack session) can last for hours or days
                Pulses are 300Gbps
