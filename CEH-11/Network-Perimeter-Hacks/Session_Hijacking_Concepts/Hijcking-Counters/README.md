Session Hijacking Countermeasures
Objectives:

    List and describe session hijacking detection methods
    Explain commonly employed protections against session hijacking attacks
    Define session hijacking specific security control mechanisms

#    How do we protect against session hijacking attacks?
-       Detection
            Manually detect
                More network traffic than normal
                Packet inspection with Wireshark
                ARP Cache Entries
-            Automation
                IDS/IPS
                SIEM w/real-time threat protection

-    What about preventative measures?
        Switch to encrypted protocols and applications
            Telnet < SSH
            HTTP < HTTPS
            IP < IPsec
-        Web Apps
#            End-Users
-                ALWAYS LOG OUT!
-                Don't click links in emails
#            Web App Devs/Admins
-                Use randomization for session IDs
-                No session for unauthenticated users if possible
-                Generate new session IDs after login
-                Verify session is coming from same host
-                    Look at things like source IP and User Agent string
-                Set sessions to expire after logout
-                    Set sessions to expire more quickly
