Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
Objectives:

    Expalin and demonstrate how an Unvalidated Redirect/Forward can be leveraged against a target

    Unvalidated Redirect
        Used in phishing attacks to direct victim to malicious site
            Malicious site = clone of valid site
                User then 'logs in'
                    Creds are harvested by attacker
                        Victim is forwarded to legit site

    Unvalidated Forward
        Attacker can access restricted pages
