LDAP Enumeration
Objectives:  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

This is meant to act as a Phone book for network objects in a network.

# Ex: Lets say I wanted to look someone up and get their Phone Number.
	
	- I could parse the LDAP directory and get it
	Define LDAP Enumeration
    Enumerate target info with LDAP Enumeration tools

    What is LDAP and how is it used?
        Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
            Kinda like a 'phone book' of network resource attributes
               - User names
               - Email addresses
               - Phone numbers  ****
               - Groups
        Uses Port 389
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    So LDAP is just full of possibly useful info, but how do we access it?
        Windows server admins
            Server Admin Tools
            AD Explorer (Sysinternals)
        3rd-Party
        Softerra LDAP Admin
        ldapsearch
            ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://192.168.241.200 -b '' -s base'(objectclass=*)'

#Ex: So when you are going to send an e-mail and your typing kat... and the autofill finishes it katy. It is parsing that data from the LDAP
# directory.



- On the windows machine you want to spin up Active Directory Users and Computers
# This feature happens to be installed on a windows 2016 server
# This is now your command center.
# go through all the objects
# Right click and add new gorup/ user / ...

‚îî‚îÄ# ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://10.0.0.1 -b '' -s base'(objectclass=*)'  
ldap_sasl_bind(SIMPLE): Can't contact LDAP server (-1)


# So right here we are getting informatio back on the your target Doman using the LDAP service.
f you are not running the search directly on the LDAP server, you will have to specify the host with the ‚Äú-H‚Äù option.

$ ldapsearch -x -b <search_base> -H <ldap_host>

As an example, let‚Äôs say that you have an OpenLDAP server installed and running on the 192.168.178.29 host of your network.

If your server is accepting anonymous authentication, you will be able to perform a LDAP search query without binding to the admin account.

$ ldapsearch -x -b "dc=devconnected,dc=com" -H ldap://192.168.178.29

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To search LDAP using the admin account, you have to execute the ‚Äúldapsearch‚Äù query with the ‚Äú-D‚Äù option for the bind DN and the ‚Äú-W‚Äù in order to be prompted for the password.

$ ldapsearch -x -b <search_base> -H <ldap_host> -D <bind_dn> -W

As an example, let‚Äôs say that your administrator account has the following distinguished name : ‚Äúcn=admin,dc=devconnected,dc=com‚Äú.

In order to perform a LDAP search as this account, you would have to run the following query

$ ldapsearch -x -b "dc=devconnected,dc=com" -H ldap://192.168.178.29 -D "cn=admin,dc=devconnected,dc=com" -W 



# F.F. LDAP does not have to be deplyed in an active directory. It can be found in linux environments as well. It is not specific to just windows
