Deep/Dark Web Recon
Objectives:

    Today we're talking about the Deep/Dark Web. Can we start by defining some of these terms?
        Surface Web
            Normal websites you're used to browsing to
                Facebook
                Google
        Deep Web
            The part of the internet not reachable(indexed) by search engines
                It's kinda 'hidden'

                    Think of content behind a paywall

                    Cloud storage

                    Web mail

                    Banking
                        Actually represents something like +/-%96 of internet content

    It can get confusing from here as we get into the Dark Net and the Dark Web. What is the difference?
        Dark Net
            This is where it gets weird
                Meant to be an 'anonymous' and hidden network by nature
                    Uses encryption
                    Can require special browsers
                        2 types of Dark Nets
                            Friend-2-Friend
                                Very anonymous Peer-2-Peer network
                                    https://freenetproject.org
                                    https://retroshare.cc/
                            Privacy Networks
                                Tor
        Dark Web
            Dark Web and Dark Net are 'related'
            Best described as 'websites that exist on the Dark Net'
                Much of it is pretty nasty stuff

    How do we access the Dark Web? Is that what the Tor browser is all about?
        Tor browser demo
            Hidden Wiki
            Markets
