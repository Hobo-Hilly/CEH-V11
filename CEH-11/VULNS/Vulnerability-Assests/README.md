Vulnerability Assessment Types
Objectives:

    List and describe the different Vulnerability Assessment types

    Active and Passive Assessments
        Active scans for hosts, services, and vulnerabilities
        Passive sniffs network for sensitive info and logged on users
    External and Internal Assessments
        External simulates APT
        Internal simulates Insider threats
    Host-Based and Network-Based Assessments
    Application Assessments
        Web apps
        Software apps
    Database Assessments



    Wireless Assessments

- Anything that can be connected wirelessly.
# 	Bluetooth?/ Cell phone?/ Headphones/ microphones

# TRUST BUT VERIFY... Words to live by.

    Credentialed and Non-Credentialed Assessments

- What kind of an attack are you supposed to be simulating?
- Insider threat /Outside Threat
- If you are insider, you will be given creds. put the creds in the .conf file of your tools. or where ever you need to.
- But the point is to take the creds and place them in your scanners so that when the tool is met with resistence/ prompted for creds
- We should be able to get through the authentication wall

# authentication wall

- and start looking around
    

	Manual and Automated Assessments

# Use human based "looking" to cipher through code. This is expensive and time consuming.

#typically companies will use both. automated and manual

# automated speeds up the assesment but Manual will afford you the opporunity to find much more esoteric vulnerabilities.
