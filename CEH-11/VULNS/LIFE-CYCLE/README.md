Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
Objectives:

    Define the Vulnerability Management Life-Cycle process
    List the VMLC phases in order
    Explain the purpose of each phase of the VMLC

    EC-Council talks about this Vulnerability Management Lifecycle (see link). Can you walk us through this and give us a little more insight?
