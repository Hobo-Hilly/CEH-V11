Vulnerability Assessment Concepts and Resources
Objectives:

    Define vulnerability research and explain its usefulness in the VA process
    List common resources used when conducting vulnerability research
    Define and explain the concepts and practices of Vulnerability Assessments
    Explain the concept and application of vulnerability databases and scoring systems

    What is a Vulnerability Assessment?
        Looking at a system to discover security weaknesses
            Helps get ahead of potential breaches
                Test new security controls and their effectiveness

    How do Vulnerability Assessors / Ethical Hackers stay current with contemporary vulnerabilities and exploits?
        Vulnerability Research
            Threat Feeds
            Discovered Security Flaws
            Professional Development

    How is a VA done?
        Active and Passive scanning
            Software
                Nessus
                OpenVAS
