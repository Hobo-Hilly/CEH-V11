Nmap: SCTP INIT and COOKIE ECHO Scans
Objectives:

    Describe the process of an SCTP INIT and COOKIE ECHO scans
    Use nmap to perform an SCTP INIT and COOKIE ECHO scans to enumerate port states and service detail
    Explain the pros and cons when utilizing these types of scans

NOTES for DANIEL Can run an SCTP server with NCAT using --sctp switch Capture SCTP traffic with Wireshark for demo

    Kathy
        How SCTP works (4-way handshake)
            Host1 >----INIT-----> Host2
            Host1 <--INIT-ACK---< Host2
            Host1 >-COOKIE-ECHO-> Host2
            Host1 <-COOKIE-ACK--< Host2

    Now that we have the basics down, tell us about the INIT scan.
        -sY option
        Attacker >----INIT-Chunk----> Target
        Attacker <--INIT+ACK-Chunk--< Target
            Port is OPEN
        Attacker >----INIT-Chunk----> Target
        Attacker <---ABORT-Chunk----< Target
            Port is CLOSED
            Port is FILTERED if
                No response
                ICMP Unreachable

    COOKIE ECHO scan
        -sZ option
            "Stealthy"
                Some non-stateful firewalls can't block
                    Advanced IDS/IPS can detect
                Sends COOKIE ECHO Chunk to target
                    Target doesn't respond
                        Port is OPEN
                    Target responds with ABORT Chunk
                        Port is CLOSED
==================================================================

This is the SCTCP scan. 

Stream Control Transmission Protocol

Differences:  TCP == 3 way handshake  SCTP == 4 way handshake

	The Tranmission Protocol communicates in "CHUNKS" instead of Packets in a TCP connection.

# There are the 'INIT' 'INIT_ACK' 'COOKIE_ECHO' 'COOKIE_ACK' CHUNKS that make up the '4 Way Handshake'  




Ex: pcap from wire shark				
	    Source		Destination		PROTOCOL
#CHUNKS
INIT        192.168.241.132  -- >  192.168.241.1     	SCTP		# comes from ip that initiates the conversation

INIT_ACK    192.168.241.1  --> 192.168.241.132   	SCTP		# comes from the ip acknowledging the start of the conversation 

COOKIE_ECHO   192.168.241.132 --> 192.168.241.1		SCTP		# comes from 

COOKIE_ACK    192.168.241.1  -->  192.168.241.132	SCTP		# 

==========     Packets immediately following 4 way handshake  =======

DATA		192.168.241.132 --> 192.168.241.1    	SCTP 

SACK 		192.168.241.1  -->  192.168.241.132     SCTP
