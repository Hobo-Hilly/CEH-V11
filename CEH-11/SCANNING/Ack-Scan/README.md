Nmap: ACK Scan
Objectives:

    Describe the process of an ACK scan
    Use nmap to perform an ACK scan to enumerate ports states and map firewall rules
    Explain the pros and cons when utilizing this type of scan

    Kathy
        Used in attempt to map firewall/filtering rules for target

# reason you would want to use an ACK scan

Learning Scenario: Lets say you are scanning a target and you would like to know if perhaps a firewall of somesort is blocking any of our
quieries. 
So your thinking maybe some ports on this machine aren't showing up
because there is a firewall in the way stoping that from occuring.

So now we want to use an ACK scan to see if this is in fact the case.
	
# This behaves the same way the XMAS scan does just uses different flags.
# And because it's using different flags. We as testers, are hoping for a different response. 
# And this information in turn can help us put the security pieces of the puzzle together.
# Just helps us get the best look at the network and whats really going on
===================================================================


	How is that done?
        Send an ACK and random sequence number
            NO RESPONSE = filtered
            RST = not filtered

                Only works on RFC 793 compliant stacks
     Sudo   nmap -sA <targetIP>

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/CEH/SCANNING/Xmas-Maimon]
â””â”€# nmap -sA 10.0.0.106
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-03-10 19:20 UTC
Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.106
Host is up (0.0000070s latency).
All 1000 scanned ports on 10.0.0.106 are in ignored states.
Not shown: **1000 unfiltered tcp ports** (reset)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.46 seconds


# If I receive a response it is unfiltered...
# So this means according to these results We received a bunch of RST(reset) packets
# This scan isn't looking for open ports
# This scan is searching for filtering and the results say " 1000 unfiltered tcp ports (reset) "
		Laymans:
# Since the target(scanned) machine sent back the thing we expected it to send back 
# Means NONE of these ports are filtered.
# So now we know there is no filter in front of us we can proceed accordingly
# BUT and this is a big BUT these results could mean that this system
# is not RFC 793 compliant
	So this starts to break all the way down to things like how well do you know your target?
	If your more familiar with your target maybe trust the results from the scan	
	conversely if you are not very familiar with your target. Maybe take those results with a grain of salt.

===================================================================

    I understand there are some variations to this type of scan?
        TTL-based
            If TLL values are lower than 64
            nmap -ttl 70 <targetIP>
                Learn target's TTL through packet inspection

# if you look through the capture above you will see that we have some return < 70 (64) and some return @ 70.
# Typically when going through this type of scan's DATA you want to look for anything that returns a TTL or 
# time to live that is smaller then the one you set. This is because if you set the time for the packet to live 
# @ 70 and it's being interacted with before it times out. Then that means that there is something alive at the 
# other end of the port. So we are almost ALWAYS looking for something smaller than the time we set.
	NOTE: Make sure you are looking at RCVD for received packets.


#BWT 
# We are just looking for anything out of the norm here. something that isn't ttl=64 
                

		    --reason
        Window-based
            All about the window size
                If target returns
                    RST + Non-Zero Window = Port OPEN
                    RST + Zero Window = Port CLOSED

                    No Response = FILTERED

                        Can't really trust this scan as the OS may not be compliant

                            See man nmap and search for -sW

-sW (TCP Window scan)
           Window scan is exactly the same as ACK scan except that it exploits an implementation detail of certain systems to differentiate
           open ports from closed ones, rather than always printing unfiltered when a RST is returned. It does this by examining the TCP
           Window field of the RST packets returned. On some systems, open ports use a positive window size (even for RST packets) while
           closed ones have a zero window. So instead of always listing a port as unfiltered when it receives a RST back, Window scan lists
           the port as open or closed if the TCP Window value in that reset is positive or zero, respectively.

           This scan relies on an implementation detail of a minority of systems out on the Internet, so you can't always trust it. Systems
           that don't support it will usually return all ports closed. Of course, it is possible that the machine really has no open ports.
           If most scanned ports are closed but a few common port numbers (such as 22, 25, 53) are filtered, the system is most likely
           susceptible. Occasionally, systems will even show the exact opposite behavior. If your scan shows 1,000 open ports and three
           closed or filtered ports, then those three may very well be the truly open ones.
#	NOTE: We really only need to pull this out if you have tried scanning with the normal SYN SYN/ACK RST
#	flags/switches aren't returning anything.

 The --packet-trace command is fire!! It's flipping basically CLI wireshark attached to NMAP. HOLY CRAP! Nerd Alert!
