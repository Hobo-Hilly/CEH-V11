Network Scanning Types
Objectives

    Identify and apply the 3 types of network scanning
    State the objectives of network scanning

    What is network scanning?
        The active process of utilizing networking technologies to gather information about a target network
    What are the types of network scanning?
        Network scanning aka HOST DISCOVERY (CEH definition)
        Port/Service scanning
        Vulnerability scanning
    What are the objectives of network scanning?
        Discover live network hosts
        Discover OS
    What are the objectives of Port/Service scanning?
        Discover which port/services are running on target host(s)
        Discover versioning info about services running on target host(s)
    What are the objectives of Vulnerability scanning
        Discover weaknesses in target hosts
            These will be prioritized by probability of ease of exploit

All about information gathering
	I want to learn about the environment I am going to attempt to attack

#Why we use this
	*Discover Live hosts on the network
	*Also used to discover the OS Operating System
	*So we can get a list of usable targets to start working on
	*We do this so that we can find all areas of opportunity for exploit on the network
	


# Three types of scans 
	Network Scanning. AKA Host Discovery
	* this is the finding of targets on a target network


	Port Scanning
	* What ports are open/ are there any services running on those ports? / If so what are those services
	
	
	Vulnerability Scanning 
	*  Now that we know what is running on the network it is time to research if there are any CVE's for the items we found on the network.
	*  Use your knowledge too. Old versions of FTP Telnet ssh annonymous log in
