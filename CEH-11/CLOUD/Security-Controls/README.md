    Define common cloud security 'best practices'
    List and describe common cloud security tools

#    Standard Security Controls
-        SDLC
-        Patches/Updates
-        Change Defaults
-        Firewall/IDS/IPS/WAF
-        Logging/Monitoring

-        Encryption
-        AV/Endpoint Protection

#    Cloud Specific
-        Secure Your S3 Buckets
-            IAM user policies
-                public/everyone = just say no!
