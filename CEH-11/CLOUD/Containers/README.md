Container Basics
Objectives:

-    Define containers
-    Define orchestration
-    List common container management platforms
-    Define Docker and describe its use
-    Explain the main components of Docker
-    List and describe common security issues associated with Containers

#    What is a container?
-        Portable Software package/bundle
-            Config files
-            Libraries
-            Dependencies
                Everything needed to run an app
-                    Consistent across platforms
-                Scalable
-                Cost effective
#        5-Tier Container Architecture (As defined by CEH)

#            Tier1: Developer Machines
-                Image Creation, Testing, and Accreditation


#            Tier2: Testing and Accreditation Systems
-                Verification and Validation of image contents
-                Signing Images
-                Sending Images to Registry

#            Tier3: Registries
-                Storing Images
-                Delivering Images to Orchestrators based on requests


#            Tier4: Orchestrators
-                Transforming Images into Containers
-                Deploying Containers to Hosts


#            Tier5: Hosts
-                Operating and managing Containers as instructed by the Orchestrator

#    What is Docker?
        Open source containerization platform
            Building .......\
            Deploying ------> Containerized Apps
            Managing.... /

#        Terms
-            Images: Basic foundation for building of containers

-            Container: Created from Images and run the actual application

-            Docker Daemon: Background service that listens for Docker API requests and manages docker objects like Images, Containers, Networks, and Volumes

-            Docker Client: Primary way most users interact with Docker

-            Docker Registry: aka Docker Hub. Repo of official Images. Private registries are configurable

-            Dockerfile: Simple text file that contains a list of commands that the Docker client calls while creating an image



#    What is orchestration?
        Automation of container lifecycle
            Provisioning
            Configuring
            Deploying
            Security
            Monitoring
            Resource allocation
            Scaling
        Orchestration Apps
            Docker Swarm
            Kubernetes
            OpenShift
            Ansible

    Container Security Challenges
        Large attack surface
            Increased complexity through many objects
                Containers
                Apps
                Databases
        Container breakout
            Attacker can breach the 'wall' between the container and host
                Running as root
        Vulnerable source code
            Devs use containers for testing code
                Could expose org to attack through insecure code
        Insecure storage of secrets
            API Keys
            Usernames
            Passwords
        Noisy Neighbor
            Containers may exhaust resources
                Makes other containers fail due to lack of resources
