Wireless Basics
Objectives:

    Identify and describe the components that make up wireless networks

    Wireless features
        AP (Access Point)
        WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)
        BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier)
            MAC address of the AP
        SSID (Service Set Identifier)
            The 'name' of the AP
            Maximum length of 32 bytes
        Association
            Connecting to an AP

#    Wireless Standards
-        802.11 is the main standard
            802.11a
-                5Ghz
-                35-100 meters
-                54 Mbps
            802.11b
-                2.4Ghz
-                35-140 meters
-                11 Mbps
            802.11g
                2.4Ghz
-               38-140 meters
-               54 Mbps
            802.11n
                2.4Ghz | 5Ghz
-               70-250 meters
-               54 -600 Mbps



#    Authentication Types
-        Open
            Any device can 'authenticate' or associate with the AP
-        Pre-Shared Key
            Basically a password
-        Centralized Authentication
            RADIUS server

#    Types of antenna
-        Directional
            Yagi (UHF/VHF)
-        Omnidirectional
-        Parabolic Grid (grid meaning 'what the dish material is made of')
-        Reflector
            Reflects and concentrates EM radiation

#    Wireless Encryption
-        WEP       (Wireless Equivalent Protection)
			We dont't like WEP
			This can be guessed because it get re-used
-            24-bit static IV
                Sent in cleartext
-            RC4 (Rivest Cypher 4)
                The IV makes up part of the encryption key
-                40 - 104 bit length
		Weak Protocol
		They are only 104 bytes or more 
-            CRC-32
                No cryptographic integrity protection
#        WPA
-            48-bit IV
-            RC4 + TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)
-                Generates new key for each packet
-                128 bit length
-            Predictable Group Temporal Key(GTK)
-                From an insecure Random Number Generator
-                Allows for injection and decryption of traffic
-            Password cracking
#        WPA2
-            48-bit IV
-            AES-CCMP
-                Counter Mode Cypher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol
-                128 bits
-            2 modes
-                Personal
-                    Uses PSK
-                Enterprise
-                    Uses centralized authentication
#        WPA3
-            AES-GCMP 256
-                Galois/Counter Mode
-                192 bit
-                Personal and Enterprise modes
