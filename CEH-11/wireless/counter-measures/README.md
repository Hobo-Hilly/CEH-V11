Wireless Hacking Countermeasures
Objectives:

    Wireless Security Controls

        Patches/Updates
            Clients
            Firmware for APs

        Change AP defaults
            Opt into the security features of your AP
                APs are insecure by default so that you can access it out of the box
                    The assumption is that you will enable the security features
                        Security features need to be unique to your environment

        Strong PSK passwords/phrases
            No dictionary words here
            Sufficient length and complexity
            Passwords are like underwear
                They will eventually stink, so change often!

        Use the strongest encryption possible
            No less than WPA2
                Enterprise is best

        SSID Obfuscation
            To broadcast or not to broadcast? That is the question!
                aka SSID Cloaking
            Change the default SSID
                Can be too descriptive (make, model, etc)

        Disable remote login!

        Add extra layers of protection
            NAC/NAP
                https://www.packetfence.org/
            VPN
            Network segmentation
                Firewall/IDS/IPS
                    https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/wireless/adaptive-wireless-ips-software/index.html

        Forbid public wifi use!

        Physical security of devices

        Scheduled audits
            Wifi surveys
                Compare results to baselines
                Update baselines whenever approved changes are made
                Heat maps
                    Control AP placement and/or signal strength to keep signal from bleeding signal into untrusted areas
                        Parking lots
                        Adjacent buildings
            Packet Capture and Analysis
